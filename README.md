A project that takes input in the form of two CSVs and adds extra time or attempts for students on a list of quizzes.

* Terminal (or Jupyter) will prompt user and generate input .csv templates:
   * Edit `input/student_input.csv` with a list of students with corresponding extra attempts and time
   * Edit `input/quiz_input.csv` to specify quizzes to affect
* Terminal (or Jupyter) will ask for inputs and confirmations
* Errors will be shown when necessary by the interface, and failed attempts will be logged in `/src/log` (a log is generated any time the script is run)

## :warning: Important Caveats

* This script only works with **Canvas Classic Quizzes**
* The attempt and time extensions will be overwritten when you run this script (does not add extra attempts or time, replaces them)
* The script assumes that you want to extend the time and/or attempts for each student for each quiz listed
* We have not tested the behaviour of this script for non-published or past-due quizzes

## Inputs

You will need
1. Canvas API Token
1. Canvas Course ID
2. Student and Quiz CSVs *(Templates generated when run)*
